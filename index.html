		      <h2>Life after Google: The Fall of Big Data and the Rise of the Blockchain Economy</h2>
		      <h5>by George Gilder. 276 pgs. Finished 11/11</h5>
		      <p><b>Rating:</b> 3.71 / 5.00</p>
		      <p><b>Review:</b> <br> I read the first half of the book in the Fall of 2020 and was intrigued by the core premise of a new internet fundamentally based on security, value, and decentralization â€” the antithesis of the current monolithic <i>walled gardens</i> of information that dominate our online lives. The author is no doubt extremely knowledgeable and visionary, but I found that the writing often dove too deep into the inner workings of different technologies and concepts, such as lidar and GPU chips, which detracted from the broader meaning of the book. However, the core concepts of this book, from building an internet of value to promoting the contratrian and entreprenuerial views of the Thiel Fellowship, are nonetheless inspiring. A year later, in the Fall of 2021, at the cusp of the biggest bull run in the history of Crypto and the explosion of Defi, I am beginning to see the endless possibilities of the Blockchain economy outlined in this book come to fruition.</p>

Not should the rest of us. The world will not wait"</i> (p. 226)</p>

	      	<h2>A Promised Land</h2>
	      	<h5>by Barack Obama. 701 pgs. Read 10/14 - 11/02</h5>
		      <p><b>Rating:</b> 4.72 / 5.00</p>
		      <p><b>Review:</b> <br>I chose this book to get an inside look on former President Obama's life in office. This book is very long (701 pages), but a great read, full of detail and insights. What I found most inspiring is how scrupulous, conscientious, and humble Obama truly is. Solving worldwide crises alongside a heavily partisan nation and scrutinous media while maintaining harmony between your friends, family, and mental state is no easy feat. Will be looking forward to the sequel.</p>

	        <h2>1984</h2>
	       	<h5>by George Orwell. 328 pgs. Read 10/02 - 10/12</h5>
		      <p><b>Rating:</b> 4.45 / 5.00</p>
		      <p><b>Review:</b><br>Illustrates the horrors of life in a totalitarian dystopia, which is sadly not unlike some modern-day authoritarian countries. Truly makes you feel grateful to live in a country that allows freedom of thought and speech. At times, the book felt monotonous in its dreary mood. Nevertheless, it was definitely an insightful read.</p>
		      <p><b>Favorite Quote:</b><br><i>"But there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye"</i> (p. 128)</p>
