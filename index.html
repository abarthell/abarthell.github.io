	      	<h2>A Promised Land</h2>
	      	<h5>by Barack Obama. 701 pgs. Read 10/14 - 11/02</h5>
		      <p><b>Rating:</b> 4.72 / 5.00</p>
		      <p><b>Review:</b> <br>I chose this book to get an inside look on former President Obama's life in office. This book is very long (701 pages), but a great read, full of detail and insights. What I found most inspiring is how scrupulous, conscientious, and humble Obama truly is. Solving worldwide crises alongside a heavily partisan nation and scrutinous media while maintaining harmony between your friends, family, and mental state is no easy feat. Will be looking forward to the sequel.</p>
		      <p><b>Favorite Quote:</b><br> <i>"With a sound process â€” one in which I was able to empty out my ego and really listen, following facts and logic as best I could ... I realized I could make tough decisions and still sleep easy at night"</i> (p. 294)</p>

	        <h2>1984</h2>
	       	<h5>by George Orwell. 328 pgs. Read 10/02 - 10/12</h5>
		      <p><b>Rating:</b> 4.45 / 5.00</p>
		      <p><b>Review:</b><br>Illustrates the horrors of life in a totalitarian dystopia, which is sadly not unlike some modern-day authoritarian countries. Truly makes you feel grateful to live in a country that allows freedom of thought and speech. At times, the book felt monotonous in its dreary mood. Nevertheless, it was definitely an insightful read.</p>
		      <p><b>Favorite Quote:</b><br><i>"But there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye"</i> (p. 128)</p>
